## What is Polly?

[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, Cache aside and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner. Polly targets .NET 4.0, .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 1.0. 

Polly is a member of the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/about)!
